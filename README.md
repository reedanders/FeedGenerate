### FeedGenerate

Targeted grazing is a vital component of fire mitigation in California, yet it often occurs when forage quality is at its lowest. Seeking to understand how producers can generate income from targeted grazing while minimizing supplemental feed costs, I created this final project for rangeland management, which uses linear programming to optimize feed costs for a sheep grazing operation under uncertain pasture production conditions.
